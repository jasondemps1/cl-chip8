# cl-chip8
A CHIP-8 emulator in Common Lisp. Why not?!

## License
GNU GPL v3

## What is it?
The [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 "CHIP-8 Description") is an interpreted language written in the mid 70's. It's useful as an exercise to explore emulation, machine architecture, etc. This is one-such exercise, but in the land of Common Lisp!

## How to use it?
+ Stand up a CL development environment. **Explanation Later**
+ Load the project via ASDF or Quicklisp.
+ **TODO:** no way to load a decently sized program in without true pain.
+ Execute the emulator by calling executing `(main)`.

## Why?
Why not? Learning is fun and Common Lisp is a great language to learn. Figured I'd learn some cheap emulation along with a great language. The code is full of macros and other goodies I've found along the way.

Hopefully it could be helpful to the aspiring Common Lisp developer. :)

Descriptions and things to follow when it's a bit more solidified.
